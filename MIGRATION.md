does my current code match up to the multi-perspective-ai-instructions?

I'll search the project knowledge first to understand the exact requirements, then compare them to your code.

Now let me compare your code against the project instructions:

Here are the files and directories up to 2 levels deep in /mnt/user-data/uploads, excluding hidden items and node_modules:

Let me view the uploaded instructions to compare against your code:

Summary

Your code is partially aligned but has critical gaps. Here's the quick breakdown:

What's Good:

    ✓ 9 perspectives implemented
    ✓ Core methods (QUICK, CONFLICT, STAKEHOLDER, etc.)
    ✓ Correct Claude model (Sonnet 4)
    ✓ Basic bandwidth detection works

What's Broken/Missing:

    ❌ Perspectives 8 & 9 are swapped (CONFIDENCE & MEANING-MAKER in wrong order)
    ❌ Vision requirements not tracked (4 methods REQUIRE vision statements)
    ❌ Missing 3 SYNTHESIS variants (SIMPLE, ALL, INNER_PEACE - you have generic)
    ❌ Expression assessment missing (optimal/over/underdeveloped detection)
    ❌ No output style detection (NATURAL/STRUCTURED/ABBREVIATED)
    ❌ No role context detection (professional vs personal)
    ❌ Missing 3 methods: COACHING PLAN, SKILLS, NOTES SUMMARY

The most critical fixes needed are the perspective order, vision requirement tracking, and expression assessment framework—these are foundational to how the Moore Multiplicity Model works.

I've created a detailed comparison report showing exactly what needs fixing, with code examples and priority levels.

are you able to give me just the files I need to add and/or update?

I'll create the updated files you need to add/replace.

Now the updated claudeHandler.js:

Now the updated server.js:

Perfect! Now let me create a quick migration guide:

Perfect! Here's what you need:
Files Ready to Download

I've created 4 files in /outputs:

    mpaiInstructions.js - Complete replacement (all 14 methods, corrected perspective order, expression assessment, output styles)
    claudeHandler.js - Complete replacement (style/context detection, all new detection functions)
    server.js - Complete replacement (new endpoints, enhanced suggestions)
    MIGRATION_GUIDE.md - Quick reference for what changed and how to update your frontend

Key Updates Summary

✅ Fixed: Perspectives 8 & 9 were swapped (now MEANING-MAKER viii, CONFIDENCE ix) ✅ Added: 3 new analysis methods (COACHING_PLAN, SKILLS, NOTES_SUMMARY) ✅ Added: 3 SYNTHESIS variants (SIMPLE, ALL, INNER_PEACE) ✅ Added: Output styles (NATURAL, STRUCTURED, ABBREVIATED) ✅ Added: Role context detection (professional vs personal) ✅ Added: Expression assessment framework ✅ Added: Vision requirement tracking ✅ Renamed: Some methods for clarity (CONFLICT → CONFLICT_RESOLUTION, etc.)

Just replace your three JS files with these updated versions and update your frontend as needed per the migration guide.

Files to Replace

Replace your existing files with these updated versions:
1. utils/mpaiInstructions.js (CRITICAL)

Changes:

    ✅ Fixed perspective order (MEANING-MAKER is now viii, CONFIDENCE is now ix)
    ✅ Added all 14 analysis methods (was 11)
    ✅ Added expression assessment framework
    ✅ Added output style support (NATURAL, STRUCTURED, ABBREVIATED)
    ✅ Added role context detection (professional, personal)
    ✅ Added vision requirement tracking for required vs optional
    ✅ Updated buildMPAIPrompt() to accept outputStyle and roleContext

New method names:

    CONFLICT_RESOLUTION (was CONFLICT)
    STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS (was STAKEHOLDER)
    PATTERN_RECOGNITION (was PATTERN)
    SCENARIO_TEST (same)
    TIME_HORIZON (same)
    Added: SIMPLE_SYNTHESIS, SYNTHESIS_ALL, INNER_PEACE_SYNTHESIS
    Added: COACHING_PLAN, SKILLS, NOTES_SUMMARY

2. utils/claudeHandler.js (IMPORTANT)

Changes:

    ✅ Updated callMPAI() to pass outputStyle and roleContext
    ✅ Enhanced detectBandwidth() with additional keywords
    ✅ NEW: detectOutputStyle() - detects NATURAL/STRUCTURED/ABBREVIATED
    ✅ NEW: detectRoleContext() - detects professional vs personal context
    ✅ Updated suggestMethod() with all 14 methods
    ✅ NEW: shouldSuggestSynthesisAll() - determines if SYNTHESIS_ALL should be offered
    ✅ NEW: getMethodDescription() - human-readable method descriptions

Updated function signatures:
javascript

// OLD:
callMPAI(userQuery, method, perspectiveVisibility)

// NEW:
callMPAI(userQuery, method, outputStyle, roleContext)

3. server.js (IMPORTANT)

Changes:

    ✅ Updated /api/analyze endpoint to handle outputStyle and roleContext
    ✅ Added session analysis count detection for SYNTHESIS_ALL suggestions
    ✅ NEW: /api/methods - returns all available methods
    ✅ NEW: /api/styles - returns available output styles
    ✅ Enhanced response with suggestions and analysis number tracking
    ✅ Updated detection logic to use all new detection functions

Updated request/response:
javascript

// OLD request:
{
  userQuery,
  method,
  perspectiveVisibility,
  sessionId
}

// NEW request:
{
  userQuery,
  method,
  outputStyle,
  roleContext,
  sessionId
}

// NEW response includes:
{
  outputStyle,
  roleContext,
  analysisNumber,
  suggestions: {
    shouldSuggestSynthesis,
    synthesisSuggestion
  }
}

Breaking Changes
1. Method Name Changes

If your frontend uses method names, update these:
javascript

// OLD → NEW
'CONFLICT' → 'CONFLICT_RESOLUTION'
'STAKEHOLDER' → 'STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS'
'PATTERN' → 'PATTERN_RECOGNITION'

2. Parameter Changes
javascript

// OLD:
POST /api/analyze
{ perspectiveVisibility: 'visible' }

// NEW:
POST /api/analyze
{ outputStyle: 'natural', roleContext: 'personal' }

3. Perspective Visibility

Replaced perspectiveVisibility with outputStyle:

    visible → structured (show perspective labels)
    invisible → natural (no labels, flowing prose)
    NEW: abbreviated (streamlined, bullets okay)

Non-Breaking Changes

These changes are backward compatible (won't break existing code):
detectBandwidth()

    Still returns 'LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH'
    Added more crisis keywords
    More accurate detection

suggestMethod()

    Still returns a method string
    Now suggests from 14 methods instead of 11
    Smarter detection logic

Database Schema

    No changes required
    Can optionally store outputStyle and roleContext in analyses

Testing Checklist

After updating, test these scenarios:

    QUICK analysis still works
    All 14 methods can be called
    NATURAL style produces flowing prose (no labels)
    STRUCTURED style shows perspective names
    ABBREVIATED style produces short output
    Professional context detected from "coach/leader/team" keywords
    Personal context detected from "family/relationship" keywords
    SYNTHESIS_ALL suggested after 2+ analyses
    Vision statements appear in HUMAN_HARM_CHECK and SYNTHESIS methods
    Expression levels shown in SYNTHESIS methods

Frontend Changes Needed

If you have a frontend, update these areas:
1. Method Selection UI

Add new methods to dropdown:
javascript

const methods = [
  'QUICK', 'FULL', 'CONFLICT_RESOLUTION', 'STAKEHOLDER_ANALYSIS',
  'PATTERN_RECOGNITION', 'SCENARIO_TEST', 'TIME_HORIZON',
  'HUMAN_HARM_CHECK', 'SIMPLE_SYNTHESIS', 'SYNTHESIS_ALL',
  'INNER_PEACE_SYNTHESIS', 'COACHING_PLAN', 'SKILLS', 'NOTES_SUMMARY'
];

2. Output Style Selection

Add UI for style preference:
javascript

const styles = [
  { key: 'natural', name: 'Natural Flow', desc: 'Integrated narrative' },
  { key: 'structured', name: 'Structured', desc: 'Show perspective labels' },
  { key: 'abbreviated', name: 'Brief', desc: 'Core insights only' }
];

3. API Request Updates
javascript

// OLD:
const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userQuery,
    perspectiveVisibility: 'visible'
  })
});

// NEW:
const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userQuery,
    outputStyle: 'natural',
    roleContext: 'personal'
  })
});

4. New Endpoints to Use
javascript

// Get all available methods
GET /api/methods

// Get all available output styles
GET /api/styles

// Get method suggestion with details
POST /api/method/suggest
{ userQuery, sessionId }

Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

    Keep backup of original mpaiInstructions.js, claudeHandler.js, server.js
    New code is backward compatible on DB level - no data migration needed
    Just revert the three files and previous functionality will work

Questions?

Key changes to understand:

    Perspective order: viii is now MEANING-MAKER, ix is CONFIDENCE
    Output style: Replaces visible/invisible with 3 options
    Role context: New parameter that changes terminology
    14 methods: All new methods map to existing framework
    Vision tracking: Some methods now require vision statements
    Expression assessment: Internal, surfaced only in SYNTHESIS methods

All changes align with the October 25, 2025 MPAI Instructions.
